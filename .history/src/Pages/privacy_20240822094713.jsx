                How We Protect Your Personal Information
              </h1>
              <p className="text-xl font-normal">
                We take appropriate security measures (including physical,
                electronic and procedural measures) to help safeguard your
                personal information from unauthorized access and disclosure.
                However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although
                we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and
                you should not expect, that your personal information, searches,
                or other communications will always remain secure. Users should
                also take care with how they handle and disclose their personal
                information and should avoid sending personal information
                through insecure email. Please refer to the Federal Trade
                Commission’s website for information about how to protect
                yourself against identity theft.
